					<h5>What technologies do you used in ?</h5>
					<p>Kodigon is based essentially on <a href="http://www.angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> framework. I use too <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a> as UI library and many opensourced librairies (see complete list <a href="#">here</a>) for encoding and decoding data.</p>
